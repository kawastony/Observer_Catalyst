# ObserverCatalyst - Q-Calibration System

A web application based on the Theory of Everything (TOE) framework by Tony Kawas. This app quantifies Observer Quality through biofeedback integration and quantum collapse bias modeling.

## Features

- **Q-Calibration Sessions**: Real-time monitoring of your Observer Quality score
- **Biofeedback Tracking**: Manual mood and stress input with planned wearable integration
- **Fear Density Monitoring**: Track emotional fragmentation patterns
- **Quantum Collapse Bias**: Visualize how your Q-state influences probability distributions
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Historical session data with charts and recommendations
- **Dice Simulation**: Proof-of-concept demonstration of observer-dependent quantum effects

## Core Concepts

- **Q Score (0-1)**: Observer Quality representing your relationship with consciousness coherence
- **Fear Density**: Fragmentation metric based on stress and emotional state
- **Collapse Bias**: Predicted quantum influence from your current Q-state
- **Ocean/Neutral/Tank States**: Three consciousness levels based on Q thresholds

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Visualizations**: Recharts
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth

## Getting Started

1. Sign up for an account
2. Start your first calibration session
3. Input your mood and stress levels at regular intervals
4. Track your Q-score evolution and receive personalized recommendations
5. Explore the dice simulation to see quantum collapse bias in action

## Mathematical Foundation

Based on Tony Kawas's TOE framework:
- Ψ_TOE = Q × (Laws 1-4) × (Forces 1-7) + D(Fear,Q) Perturbation
- Q computation: S_sync(coherence) × (1 - D_fear)
- Collapse bias: Q × (1 + k_symbiosis × ln(Q))

## Future Enhancements

- EEG integration for neural coherence monitoring
- HRV monitoring for heart-brain synchronization
- Advanced visualization of consciousness state trajectories
- Community features for collective Q-calibration
